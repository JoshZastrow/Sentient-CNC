Purpose of Document:
This serves as a starting point for collecting information as a means to build a bill of materials for the first round prototype. The intended goal is to get a list of hardware components, prices, where to buy and estimated lead time for initial purchase. Additionally, for the sake of clarity a write-up on each component and why it is needed for a functional prototype.

Device Requirements:
Needs to collect image data (may need high resolution and/or zoom capabilities)
Needs to collect IR image data
Needs to collect high quality sound data
Needs to collect vibration data
Possibly needs directional lighting on part
Needs to send data to cloud storage
Sensor housing needs to be water resistant
